Here is a 2 min tutorial on how to create a "Notepad" to quickly scribble and take down notes inside your OBS Studio.

Please note: The notes data is private and stored locally inside your OBS application. It is not public and no one can access them.

Disclaimer: Notes can get lost if OBS update, so please don't save important stuff!
